# SRUP

## Secure Remote Update Protocol
The Secure Remote Update Protocol (SRUP) is a secure & confirmable command-and-control (C2) protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT), based on MQTT.

SRUP is designed to provide an easy way to communicate details of a required software update to an IoT device â€“ but it's not limited just software updates; the protocol can be extended to support any type of C2 message.

Further details of the protocol may be found in the papers:
