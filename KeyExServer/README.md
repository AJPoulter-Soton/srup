# KeyExchange Server

This is the code for the key exchange server... 

This code (together with the neccessary keys, which you'll need to generate using OpenSSL) should be run on a suitable webserver, with the URL used as the config for the pySRUP applications...

You'll need to update the server.cfg file to add the URL for the MQTT broker, and the UUID for the server.
